    <h1>Forever</h1>
    <p>So basically I’m rewriting the entire paragraph.  All I’ve tried to do is something creative something different. Basically this is the only productive thing I’ve learnt or done in my entire winter break.</p>
    <p>I just want you to know that I will never ever want to intentionally hurt you or make you feel bad about anything. I might not be as expressive on face but trust me on the inside I just want good to happen with everyone. I really have had hard past month a lot happened in a short period of time and I’m trying my best to get back on track and fix all the mistakes I’ve made. I’ve never wanted or hoped anything bad for you. I really want to see you succeed in life and get whatever you want and stay happy.</p>
    <p>As a person I’ve made many bad mistakes but I swear none of them were intentional. There have been several times when I’ve just wanted to do the best thing for both of us but ended up taking the wrong decision only but that’s how life is you make mistakes. Our relation hasn’t been perfect but it is not just about the relationship, the bond we share is the purest and the most real thing I’ve ever seen. I’ve never felt this way before. I just want your presence beacause thats what that matters the most. I just want us to be real to be us to each other coz that’s what we’ve always done. Lets be honest. Realtionship wont work out.</p>
    <p>I want to make a promise to you, the day you become a judge or like whatever is your dream, I will give you the biggest and the most important gift of your life, no matter if we know each other anymore or we’re talking or not by then but I promise I’ll find a way and keep my words.</p>
    <p>I hope the bond stays as pure as it has always been.</p>
